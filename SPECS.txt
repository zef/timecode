== Timecode.new() should
* instantiate from int
* always coerce FPS to float
* create a zero TC with no arguments
* accept full string SMPTE timecode as well

== Timecode.at() should
* disallow more than 99 hrs
* disallow more than 59 minutes
* disallow more than 59 seconds
* disallow more frames than what the framerate permits
* propery accept usable values

== A new Timecode object should
* be frozen

== An existing Timecode should
* report that the framerates are in delta
* validate equality based on delta
* report total as it's to_i
* support hours
* support minutes
* support seconds
* support frames
* report frame_interval as a float
* be comparable
* raise on comparison of incompatible timecodes

== A Timecode of zero should
* properly respond to zero?

== An existing Timecode on inspection should
* properly present himself via inspect
* properly print itself

== An existing Timecode used within ranges should
* properly provide successive value that is one frame up
* work as a range member

== A Timecode on conversion should
* copy itself with a different framerate

== A Timecode on calculations should
* support addition
* should raise on addition if framerates do not match
* when added with an integer instead calculate on total
* support subtraction
* on subtraction of an integer instead calculate on total
* raise when subtracting a Timecode with a different framerate
* support multiplication
* raise when the resultig Timecode is negative
* return a Timecode when divided by an Integer
* return a number when divided by another Timecode

== A Timecode used with fractional number of seconds
* should properly return fractional seconds
* properly translate to frames when instantiated from fractional seconds

== A custom Timecode descendant should
* properly classify on parse
* properly classify on at
* properly  classify on calculations

== Timecode.parse should
* handle complete SMPTE timecode
* handle complete SMPTE timecode via new
* refuse to handle timecode that is out of range for the framerate
* parse a row of numbers as parts of a timecode starting from the right
* parse a number with f suffix as frames
* parse a number with s suffix as seconds
* parse a number with m suffix as minutes
* parse a number with h suffix as hours
* parse different suffixes as a sum of elements
* parse a number of digits as timecode
* truncate a large number to the parseable length
* left-pad a large number to give proper TC
* parse timecode with fractional second instead of frames
* raise when trying to parse DF timecode
* raise on improper format

== Timecode.soft_parse should
* parse the timecode
* not raise on improper format and return zero TC instead

== Timecode with unsigned integer conversions should
* parse from a 4x4bits packed 32bit unsigned int
* properly convert itself back to 4x4 bits 32bit unsigned int
